# HR Management Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview

This Power BI project is designed to assist HR managers in tracking and analyzing key metrics across different departments and countries. The dashboard is structured into multiple pages, each focusing on specific HR aspects:

1. **Salaries** - Tracks salary information on the first page.
2. **Rates and Overtime Patterns** - Analyzes department rates along with overtime patterns on the second page.
3. **Leaves Analysis** - Uses a map chart on the third page to recognize patterns in countries with high metrics for overtime, unpaid leaves, and sick leaves.
4. **Experience Trends** - Measures experience trends on the fourth page to identify countries and departments that rely on specific experience levels.

This project includes interactive features such as slicers, custom tooltips, and an interactive dashboard to enhance data exploration.

## Conclusion

- **Overtime Hours**: 
    - Quality Control, Manufacturing, and Account Management departments have notably high overtime rates.

    - Employees with 4 to 6 years of experience often work extended hours. 
- **Branches**: The Egypt branch is seeing a greater number of employees taking unpaid leaves, sick leaves, and working overtime hours than other branches.
- **Performance ratings**: 
    - Employees in the training and green building departments are consistently underperforming compared to their colleagues in other departments.
    - Due to the relatively inexperienced workforce in the training and green building departments, these departments are experiencing lower performance rates.

- **Pay gap**: The major manufacturing products and environmental health/safety departments are demonstrating a gender pay gap in favor of female employees, with average salaries exceeding those of male employees in other areas.
