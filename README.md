# HR Management Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview

This Power BI project is designed to assist HR managers in tracking and analyzing key metrics across different departments and countries. The dashboard is structured into multiple pages, each focusing on specific HR aspects:

1. **Salaries** - Tracks salary information on the first page.
2. **Rates and Overtime Patterns** - Analyzes department rates along with overtime patterns on the second page.
3. **Leaves Analysis** - Uses a map chart on the third page to recognize patterns in countries with high metrics for overtime, unpaid leaves, and sick leaves.
4. **Experience Trends** - Measures experience trends on the fourth page to identify countries and departments that rely on specific experience levels.

This project includes interactive features such as slicers, custom tooltips, and an interactive dashboard to enhance data exploration.
